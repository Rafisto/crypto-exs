### mod-ari
For reasons unbeknown to humankind our target decided to encode a flag by using pairs of integers.
We managed to obtain some of them.
Can you find the flag?

a_i = [1890, 923943128, 9700140639, 30034828954, 81893600223, 7453544462]

m_i = [2137, 1000000007, 10000000019, 100000000003, 100000000019, 100000000057]

> `FLAG{?????_???_?????}`
